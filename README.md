### 3. Folder/File Content (What to Upload)

Create the corresponding folders and populate them with content you legally own (your own work):

| Folder Name | Legal & Safe Content to Upload |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`ME-439-Mechatronics`** | **Your original solutions** to non-commercial problem sets, circuit diagrams from lab experiments, and **Final Project Reports** (excluding proprietary code). |
| **`ME-438-AI-IoT`** | [cite_start]**Your original project reports** (e.g., IoT System Design Report), study guides for concepts like YOLO or MQTT, and the **academic paper** for the YOLO-BOT[cite: 58]. |
| **`FEA-Analysis`** | [cite_start]Images or PDF reports of your own **Ansys simulation results** (e.g., mesh quality, stress plots) and associated calculation methodologies[cite: 55]. |

**CRITICAL NOTE:** Upload **your own summary notes or problem solutions**, **not** copyrighted books or full solution manuals. This maintains the academic integrity that the Meta 4.0 committee expects.
